# Voltron.io

Voltron.io is the anti-framework framework for Node.js -- a collection of
stand-alone components which can operate independently, but are most powerful
when combined.

The currently working components include:

* [voltron-model](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-model): Easily generate
data model Objects that can be used on both the server and client.

* [voltron-pg-adapter](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-pg-adapter): A
convenient interface for working with Postgres.

* [voltron-hooks](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-hooks): Add promise-based
lifecycle hooks to any object.

* [voltron-mongo-adapter](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-mongo-adpater): A
convenient interface for working with MongoDB. (Not stable/tested).

* [voltron-migrator](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-migrator): Manage SQL
migrations with Node.
